## Description

<!--
Please describe exactly what this PR changes.
If it fixes an issue, add "Fixes #XXXX"

If you're making changes to the yaml data, it's a good idea to run the schemaCheck.py yourself and make sure everything passes before submitting the pull request. You can also paste the yaml code into a validator website if that's easier for you, such as https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator

If you're making changes to html code, it's a good idea to run the Jekyll build yourself and make sure the output looks good.
