## About

This repository contains the source code for [The BIG List of Video Game Randomizers](https://randomizers.debigare.com), a community project created and [originally published](https://www.debigare.com/randomizers/) in 2016 by [Guillaume Fortin-Debigar√©](https://www.debigare.com/).

The project has been continuously maintained by him based on countless contributions by the community over the years, and is now maintained directly via open-source contributions.

## How to contribute

You can request updates to the list either by submitting an issue with the [`Submit New Randomizer` template](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list/issues/new/choose), or in the `#list-submissions` channel in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YREMzGQ3gd).

Pull requests from the public are very welcome - if you wish to become a maintainer or need help contributing, please join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YREMzGQ3gd) and see `#list-maintenance`.

## Code structure

The site's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)/[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) templates are stored in [`src`](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list/tree/main/src) and [`src/_includes/`](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list/tree/main/src/_includes), while the data is stored as a YAML file per series in [`src/series/`](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list/tree/main/src/series).

Note that all games must be in a series; if a game does not belong to a series, give the series the same name as the game.

## Building

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - if on Windows you probably want to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
- `cd src`
- `bundle install` to install dependencies
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`

This will host the site on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/rando-list/`.

You can also run the `Jekyll Build & Deploy` GitHub action & download the outputted artifact if you do not wish to install Jekyll locally.
