## 2023-01-30

I recently learned of an undocumented Steam feature that allows downloading old versions of games on their platform. While this is great in theory, the steps to do so are technical or require unofficial tools. Either way, this undocumented feature could break at any moment, as it apparently did in the past. As such, I am quite hesitant to include randomizers requiring such downloads on the list, and decided to continue excluding them for the time being, on the grounds that this is most likely not a feature intended for the general public.

## 2021-08-23

This update comes with a major change to the definition of what counts as a randomizer. More precisely, a randomizer may not force its user to apply any major change that is not designed to accomodate the randomization of the original game data.

This change is to prevent the list from being bloated with a limitless supply of randomizer variants and total conversion mods, an issue which was growing at an exponential rate. This was especially problematic for classic id Software games due to their extensive modding heritage, allowing for easy remixes and extensions of other related mods.

While this means that some fan favorites like Complex DooM are being delisted, this also has the advantage of keeping the list focused on what matters the most for me and the portion of randomizers' fans that I try to cater to: fresh, vanilla-like experiences of our favorite games.

Note that the main games affected with this change so far are The Ultimate Doom, Doom II, Heretic, Quake and Quake II. I have made a [public backup of all the delisted entries](https://pastebin.com/XCfGyKMc), for those curious.

- Marked ORO-RANDOM-DOOM as obsolete.

## 2020-12-11

This update comes with a few major changes as to what constitutes a valid entry in the list.

First, from now on, I will consider all official randomizers as being out of scope, reverting the change I did a year ago on this regard. I came to the conclusion that while there is value for including a list of games that had randomization features added post-release or that are exclusive to specific versions only, I realized that this was almost impossible to track for games that receive or received frequent updates, and I was getting more and more uncomfortable with the idea of a community-driven project on my website effectively being used as free advertisement by game publishers. As such, they have been removed. This includes Yoku's Island Express despite the randomizer feature being hidden in a Steam beta branch, and Lizard despite the randomizer being a separate tool as it is from the same author as the main game and advertised on the game's website.

Second, I will now consider randomizers that worked on old versions of games, but not with the latest according to user comments, to be out of scope if said old versions can no longer be easily acquired or played by the general public. I considered using the "OBSOLETE" tag for historical purposes, but since they unfortunately are unplayable, I see no reason to clutter the list with them. Note that as I previously did, I will provide instructions on how to acquire older builds from official sources whenever appropriate.

### Added randomizers

## 2018-05-22

About the "Corruptors", "Restrictions" and "Bingo" stuff, I have come to the following conclusions:

- Restriction generators are nice tools for convenience and inspiration, but are in general unnecessary as they can be easily replicated by generating a few random numbers at specific key points in the relevant game and associating each number with a choice the player has to comply with. The big exception is for speedrun races where the random conditions should be hidden until the race start, but I believe that such tools are better shared within the relevant speedrunning communities instead.
- Bingos are the most complex restriction generators due to their 5x5 grid format and balancing issues, so the easy replication argument does not apply for them. However, they are exclusively designed for speedrunning purposes, and I've had multiple speedrunners tell me that bingos don't actually feel random, so again I believe that such tools are better shared within the relevant speedrunning communities instead.
- Corruptions usually fall into my self-imposed exclusion of "only adding random elements over the normal game". The reason I made this exclusion in the first place is because they are generally trivial to make and usually has extremely limited replay value. Corruptors that don't have those issues unfortunately have the side-effect of causing softlocks and crashes, both of which are undesireable states within randomizer communities.

For these reasons, I no longer feel that awareness of these tools justifies their inclusion on a randomizer list. Therefore, I have decided to remove these categories and their content altogether. As a side-effect, this will also allow me to dedicate more time to the main list. [Here is a backup in case others want to pick them up and continue from where I left off](https://pastebin.com/HE4THZLM). I will consider linking to such successor lists if they become a reality.

### Added randomizers

## 2018-01-21

Alright, well even the abridged list is now too long to fit in a single ROMHacking.net post despite its minimalist design (last iteration was 14746 characters out of 15000). I might be able to tweak it, but I'm going to have the same problem in an iteration or two anyway. Besides, it was starting to be a pain to continuously update 2 similar lists but with with some elements missing between them, and written in different markup languages (BBCodes vs Markdown).

For these reasons, I decided to remove the abridged list from ROMHacking.net. From now on, the BIG list of randomizers will be available exclusively on my blog.

This was not an easy choice, but I believe it is the best thing to do for its continued development. I never expected my list to grow to its current scale nor become a common reference, and it's all thanks to you! I will continue to follow the original ROMHacking.net thread and post updates of any changes there, just like before.

Note that I'll keep the old list in strikethrough on the original post for a while during the transition period just in case.

### Added randomizers

- Dark Souls III (items)
- Final Fantasy V (passive - forgot to add the unofficial Four Job Fiesta to the list because the official one only runs a few days a year (which makes me sad))
- Game Dev Tycoon (appears broken with the latest version but wanted to list it anyway in case it gets fixed eventually)
- Hollow Knight (abilities & charms)
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (x3: alternate start, Words of Power shuffling, and a deprecated one that generates random dungeons)
- The Talos Principle
- XCOM: Enemy Unknown

### Other changes

- Added additional restrictions on was acceptable or not on the main list.
- Removed the "Unfinished" tag to the Symphony of the Night relic randomizer because I was incorrectly assuming text uploaded to Pastebin couldn't be updated.
- Answered the following fundamental question: "How the fuck do you randomize Tetris?" (actual quote from Twitch streamer Vinesauce)
- Added DELUXE variant of the multi-game bingo

## 2017-03-31

I've added a second Final Fantasy IV roguelike by abyssonym it to the list, and I'll keep the old one there too until I can figure out if it needs to be moved to the deprecated section or not.

I've also added a new Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow item randomizer, also by abyssonym!

By the way, there are two The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past randomizers floating around now. I've added the new one by Veetorp to the main list, and moved the old one by Dessyreqt to the deprecated section, because the latter has been seemingly abandoned and has been used as a base for the new one. It has many new features and bugfixes, so I highly recommend you check it out!

I also found a convenient HUD for that last randomizer that I've added alongside it that should be convenient for Twitch streamers. There's also a version for the Super Metroid item randomizer that I've also added.

## 2017-02-04

### Added randomizers:

- Metroid
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (roguelike)
- The Goonies II

I actually found two recent Metroid randomizers made within a month of each other.  I'm putting snarfblam's in the main list and Netsrotti's in the deprecated list, as it seems the only advantage of the latter over the former is an option to have duplicate upgrades.

Also, to complement the Hitman passive randomizers, I also found a bunch of nice passive randomizers hosted by Trysdyn (including a Four Job Fiesta generator available all year long) for the following games:

- Diablo II
- Final Fantasy
- Final Fantasy III
- Final Fantasy V
- Final Fantasy VI
- Legend of Mana
- Romancing SaGa 2
- Shining Soul II
- Tales of Destiny
- Zelda II: The Adventure of Link

## 2017-01-26

After investigation, I updated the the link for the Final Fantasy V Ancient Cave to point to ROMHacking.net instead of an archive.org snapshot for convenience.

I also updated the link to the Gensokyo no Nazo randomizer - it now has a proper webpage and many new features!

### Added randomizers

- Amnesia: The Dark Descent (corruptor)
- PokÃ©mon X & Y & Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire & Sun & Moon
- Zelda Classic (fangame) (randomizer quests)

Yes, this means that all main international PokÃ©mon games released so far has randomizers. Pretty cool!

And with that, the list now contains more than 100 unique games, and that's only counting official games! I never expected there would be so many when I started. Wow!

## 2017-01-23

Updated the link to the Final Fantasy randomizer following the 1.0 release.

I also added a playable work-in-progress Final Fantasy IV roguelike randomizer.

## 2017-01-11

Added a PokÃ©mon Crystal randomizer that randomly fuses PokÃ©mon with matching evolution stage.

## 2017-01-10

Added two Hitman randomizers to the list. Although they do not actually alter the games, they generate a random set of additional requirements for each mission. I decided to include them despite the lack of in-game enforcement because they still affect gameplay.

## 2017-01-03

The Guardian Legends randomizer is no longer behind a registration wall! The author kindly uploaded the latest version on RHDN after I asked him for a public link. The list has been updated accordingly.

## 2017-01-01

## 2016-12-26

## 2016-11-20

I was let known of a Paper Mario randomizer, but I've seen a few reports that it's not working. I tentatively added it to the list with a note.

## 2016-11-13

Added Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories to the list!

## 2016-11-06

### New randomizers added

- Super Meat Boy
- Super Metroid (deprecated)

## 2016-10-30

### Merged missing entries from Kaltenborn's list

- PokÃ©mon Colosseum
- Super Mario Bros.

Also, I realized that the Metroid Prime 2: Echoes randomizer was merged with the Metroid Prime randomizer, so I merged the entries as well.

## 2016-10-23

Added a new Super Mario Bros. 3 randomizer, and moved the old one as deprecated.

## 2016-10-20

Clarified supported versions for the Mega Man Battle Network games, and renamed the Dragon Quest and Fire Emblem games to their official modern titles.

## 2016-10-19

## 2016-10-02 #2

Added Reelism mod for Doom II.

## 2016-10-02

- Ultimate Doom
- Doom II
- Final Doom
- Samsara (unofficial Doom mod)
- Heretic
- Hexen
- Quake
- Quake II

Second, I also added a new randomizer for Gensokyo no Nazo.

And finally, I added a Deprecated section with old Doom, Fire Emblem and PokÃ©mon randomizers that weren't on the list before. I also moved Catastrophe's Dragon Quest and Sanqui's PokÃ©mon Red randomizers in that section, since I believe almost all of their features are included in the other ones.
